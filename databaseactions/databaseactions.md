# Oracle Database Actions

## Introduction

In this lab we will use and have a quick tour of **Oracle Database Actions**. 
**Oracle Database Actions** is a web-based interface that uses Oracle REST Data Services to provide development, data tools, administration and monitoring features for Oracle Autonomous Database.

The main features include executing your SQL statements and scripts, creating Data Modeler diagrams, developing RESTful web services, managing JSON collections, and using the Data Load, Catalog, Data Insights, Business Models, and Data Transforms tools to load data from local and remote sources, view data in your tables and views, view objects in your data dictionary, and organize, analyze, and transform your data.
